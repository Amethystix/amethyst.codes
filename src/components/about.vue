        My name is Lauren DiGiovanni, and I'm a software engineer located in Brooklyn, New York.  
        I graduated from New York University in May of 2019, earning my Bachelor's in Computer Science.  Currently, I specialize in full-stack web development, and have had a blast
        watching the ways in which JavaScript has been evolving and changing over the last few years.  It's a great time to be a young programmer!

        Aside from coding, I love to learn new things and am interested in a wide variety of subjects- I'm a classically trained double bassist of over 10 years, I love to paint, and I really enjoy cooking and learning new recipes.
        I'm always collecting things that I find interesting, especially fun gadgets, with one of my favorite trinkets to collect being Tamagotchi, the virtual pets that took the world by storm in the '90s.

        I love to spend my free time finding new caf√©s and reading books over a cortado: my favorite book is The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath.  I actively enjoy writing as well as reading, and spent one summer abroad in Paris studying creative writing.
        Someday I dream of publishing a novel.

        I also have an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/biteofmybento/?hl=en">Instagram account</a> where I post pictures of bento boxes that I make for lunch at work every day.  It's a huge outlet for my creativity, plus I love Japanese food!
